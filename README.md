Volatility underpins financial markets by encapsulating uncertainty about prices, individual behaviors, decisions and has traditionally been modeled as a semi-martingale, with consequent scaling properties. The mathematical description of the volatility process has been an active topic of research for decades; however, driven by empirical estimates of the scaling behavior of volatility, a new paradigm has emerged, whereby paths of volatility are rougher than those of semi-martingales!
In this project, I took a closer look at Jim Gatheral's "RFSV" paper and reanalyzed the DAX and S&P 500 indices. Below, you will find the results which are quite revealing.
Key Insights:
Scaling Continuity: The volatility time series demonstrate scaling continuity.
Gaussian Distributions: When scaled correctly, the distributions align with Gaussian properties.
Combining these observations, the rough fractional stochastic volatility (RFSV) model emerges as the natural choice for modeling volatility.
